<Note type="note" title="Information">
  These dependencies will be installed automatically when you install a
  component; however, you'll need to add the relevant files in their allocated
  locations where required.
</Note>

## Uploadthing

<hr />
The project on top of which these upload components are built. You can follow this [official
guide for Next.js App Router](https://docs.uploadthing.com/getting-started/appdir)
to get started.

For ease of use, 3 new `utility` files will be created inside your `/lib` folder automatically: (`uploadthing.ts`, `uploadthingui-types.ts`, and `uploadthingui-utils.ts`)

After following the guide, ensure you have your:

- `route.ts` and `core.ts` inside your `/api/uploadthing` directory.

## Zustand
<hr />
Used as the main state management solution. It's robust and enables efficient and predictable
development experience. [Click here to learn more](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs).

For organizational purposes, a new `/stores` folder will be created
which will hold relevant store files as different components might require slightly differently
structured store files.

For most upload components, a single store file will be used.
