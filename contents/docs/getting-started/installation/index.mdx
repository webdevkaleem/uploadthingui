The project ontop of which these upload components exist. You can follow this [official
guide for Next.js App Router](https://docs.uploadthing.com/getting-started/appdir)

For ease of use 3 new `utility` files will be created inside of your `/lib` folder automatically. (`uploadthing.ts`, `uploadthingui-types.ts`, and `uploadthingui-utils.ts`)

After following the guide make sure you have your:

- `route.ts` and `core.ts` inside your `/api/uploadthing`.

For management reasons a new `/stores` folder will be created

structured store files.

For most upload components a single store file would be used.
