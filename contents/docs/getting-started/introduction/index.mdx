**This is not a component library. It is how you should build your [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com) components.**

I have taken a lot of inspiration from [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) for the creation of this project.

Uploadthing is an excellent solution for file uploads but lacks styled client-side components, leaving developers to use the publicly available layer to create their own custom components.

It takes a significant amount of time to get these components right, so I wanted to save developers' time by creating beautiful defaults that are easy to install and use.

This project aims to solve:

- **Open Code:** The top layer of your component code is open for modifications, just like with shadcn.
- **Composition:** Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable and consistent.
- **Distribution:** Using [shadcn registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) for seamless distribution and installation.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Carefully chosen default styles that provide excellent design out-of-the-box.
- **State Management:** Solving complex quirks with file uploads so you won't have to deal with them while creating custom client upload components.
