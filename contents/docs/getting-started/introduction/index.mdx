**This is not a component library. It is how you should build your [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com) components.**

I have taken alot of inspiration from [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) for the creation of this project.

Uploadthing is a great solution for file uploads but lacks styled client side components thus leaving us to use the layer made public to create our own custom components.

It takes alot of time to get these components right so I wanted to save people's time by creating beautiful defaults which are easy to install and use.

This project aims to solve:

- **Open Code:** The top layer of your component code is open for modifications as it is with shadcn.
- **Composition:** Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.
- **Distribution:** Using [shadcn registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) for easy distribution.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.
- **State Management:** Solving weird quirks with file uploads so you won't have to deal with them while creating custom client upload components.
