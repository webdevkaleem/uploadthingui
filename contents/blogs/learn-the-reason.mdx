When I first started using UploadThing as my primary solution for file uploads, the experience felt almost magical. However, as I spent more time with the platform, I noticed a significant gap: there was a lack of high-quality UI components to complement its functionality. This observation sparked an idea:

"Why not develop UI components for UploadThing, similar to how shadcn created components for React?"

Of course, this was easier said than done.

I began by building a small prototype, which eventually evolved into the project as it exists today.

Beyond the initial concept, my goal was to create a fully functional and practical project. After spending years caught in "tutorial hell" and juggling academic commitments, I saw this endeavor as my first real step into the professional world.

Looking back, I am grateful that I took on this challenge. I have learned a great deal throughout this journey.

I do not have grand expectations for this project, but if it saves even one person the hassle of building their own UploadThing components, it will have been worthwhile.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
